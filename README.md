# Weather App (powered by WeatherBit.io)

A simple weather app built on Next.js and Typescript using the Weatherbit.io API. Submission for the **ACM at UCLA Dev Team's** final round assesment for Spring 2023 inductions. 


## Description

This project can be used to retrieve weather information of any city in the world. The design inspirations are from ACM's design guidelines. 

This is built on integration of TypeScript into Next.js. I used WeatherBit because of its easy to understand documentation with a variety of useful functions which costs free for 50 API calls/day. 

## Getting Started

```
npm install
```
``` 
npm run build 
```
```
npm run start
```
This compiles, builds, and executes the Next Project for use.
